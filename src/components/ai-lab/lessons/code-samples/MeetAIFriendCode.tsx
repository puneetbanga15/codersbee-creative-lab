              Here's how you might create an AI Friend in a block-based coding environment like Scratch:

              <p className="text-sm text-yellow-800">
                Note: This is a visual representation. In Scratch, you would create lists for keywords and responses,
                then use "if" blocks to check if the user's message contains items from the keyword list.

          <li>
            <strong>Character Class/Object:</strong> We create a blueprint for our AI characters with properties like name, personality, and a list of responses.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Response Matching:</strong> When a user sends a message, the AI looks for keywords in the message and returns the matching response.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Training Method:</strong> We can add new keyword-response pairs to teach our AI new responses.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Different Personalities:</strong> By creating different response sets, we give each character their unique "personality."

        </ol>

        <p className="text-purple-700 mb-3">
          You can copy this code and modify it to create your own AI character with a unique personality!
          Try adding new responses or creating an entirely new character.
        </p>
        <p className="text-purple-700">
          Challenge: Can you improve the code to handle multiple keywords in a single message? Or make it
          remember previous messages in the conversation?
